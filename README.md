# M5Stack Examples
This repository contains example code for each module of the M5Stack device. Each example demonstrates how to use the module's features and provides a starting point for developers to build their own projects. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced users.

## Getting Started
These examples are designed to be used with the M5Stack development board. Before you begin, make sure that you have the necessary hardware and software set up.

## Content
The following examples are included in this repository:

- Example 1: LED Blink - A simple example that demonstrates how to control the onboard LED.
- Example 2: Button Input - Shows how to read button inputs and use them to control the LED.
- Example 3: Display Text - Shows how to display text on the M5Stack's screen.

...and so on for each module (to be filled in)

## Contributions
This repository features code created by dedicated students who worked in the maintenance lab of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. These individuals invested a considerable amount of time and effort in creating these examples, and their hard work shines through in the high-quality code they produced.
